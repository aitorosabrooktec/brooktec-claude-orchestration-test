2. **Identify patterns** - Both good and problematic
3. **Check for consistency** - With existing codebase patterns
4. **Evaluate complexity** - Flag overly complex changes
5. **Verify completeness** - Are edge cases handled?

### Phase 4: Specialized Checks
1. **Security scan** - OWASP patterns, vulnerabilities
2. **Performance review** - Bottlenecks, optimization opportunities
3. **Accessibility check** - WCAG compliance (frontend)
4. **Testing review** - Coverage and quality

### Phase 5: Feedback Generation

2. Create a review summary file
3. Provide more detail on specific issues
4. Proceed with security audit
```

## Error Handling

### PR Not Found
- Verify PR number is correct
- Check repository access permissions
- Suggest manual PR URL if gh CLI unavailable

### Cannot Access Changed Files
- Some files may be binary or too large
- Focus on accessible files
- Note limitation in review summary

### Technology Detection Failed
- Perform generic code review
- Focus on language-agnostic patterns
- Ask user for technology context

### Conflicting Standards
- Note when code doesn't match detected patterns
- Ask if intentional deviation or inconsistency
- Suggest aligning with project conventions

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS BE CONSTRUCTIVE** - Focus on improvement, not criticism
2. **PROVIDE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES** - Show, don't just tell
3. **PRIORITIZE SECURITY** - Security issues are always critical
4. **REFERENCE FILE:LINE** - Every comment must have a location
5. **EXPLAIN WHY** - Don't just say what's wrong, explain impact
6. **SUGGEST FIXES** - Don't just identify problems, provide solutions
7. **ACKNOWLEDGE GOOD WORK** - Positive reinforcement matters
8. **BE CONSISTENT** - Apply same standards throughout
9. **RESPECT SCOPE** - Don't review unchanged code unless context-critical
10. **CONSIDER CONTEXT** - Understand why decisions were made
11. **NEVER AUTO-APPROVE** - Always require human final decision
12. **BALANCE RIGOR WITH PRAGMATISM** - Don't let perfect be enemy of good

# Pull Request Review Summary

## Overview
- **PR**: #42 - Implement user profile editing
- **Files Changed**: 8 files
- **Lines**: +558 / -48
- **Technology**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, FastAPI backend

## Key Findings

### ⛔ Critical Issues: 2

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability** - `src/api/users.ts:45`
2. **Missing Authorization Check** - `src/api/users.ts:67`

### ⚠️  High Priority: 3

1. **Password Validation Weak** - `src/auth/login.ts:89`
2. **Missing Input Sanitization** - `src/api/users.ts:34`
3. **Unhandled Error Path** - `src/components/UserProfile.tsx:123`

### ℹ️  Medium Priority: 5
[Listed with file:line references]

### ✅ Positive Highlights
- Excellent test coverage (95% for new code)
- Well-structured validation utilities
- Clear component composition
- Good TypeScript usage with strict types

## Detailed Findings

### [CRITICAL] Security: SQL Injection Vulnerability

**File**: `src/api/users.ts:45-52`

**Issue**: Direct string interpolation in SQL query allows SQL injection

**Current Code**:
​```typescript
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`;
const result = await db.execute(query);
​```

**Suggested Fix**:
​```typescript
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?';
const result = await db.execute(query, [email]);
​```

**Rationale**: Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection by separating SQL logic from data. This is a critical security vulnerability that must be fixed before merge.

**References**:
- [OWASP SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)
- [Node.js SQL Injection Prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
