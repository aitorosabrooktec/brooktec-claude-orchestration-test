Orchestrate frontend feature development:

[Extended thinking: This workflow coordinates specialized agents to deliver a secure, production-ready frontend/mobile feature with proper setup validation, clear requirements, security compliance, and user approval before PR creation. The workflow ensures the development environment is properly configured (including environment variables from Shadows), validates requirement clarity, intelligently detects the project technology (Angular web, React/Next.js web, or Mobile frameworks), and proceeds with framework-aware implementation using best practices for modern development. If the technology is ambiguous or unclear, it STOPS and asks the user to specify which framework to use. The workflow performs comprehensive security auditing, and then STOPS to request explicit user approval. The user reviews the implementation and security findings before deciding to either proceed to PR creation or request additional changes. This approval checkpoint ensures quality control and gives the user final say before submitting the feature for review. The developer agents (angular-developer, frontend-developer, or mobile-developer) automatically detect existing tooling (framework version, state management, styling, authentication, navigation) and adapt accordingly, while informing users about alternative approaches when beneficial.]

## Phase 1: Setup & Requirements Validation

### 1. Project Setup Verification
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="frontend-orchestration::project-setup"
- Prompt: "Verify and setup the development environment for the project. 
  
  Claude Project Initialization (FIRST):
  - Check if CLAUDE.md file exists in project root
  - If CLAUDE.md doesn't exist: 
    - STOP and inform user to run /init in the chat
    - Wait for user to execute /init and confirm completion
    - Re-check for CLAUDE.md after user confirms
    - Continue with remaining setup once verified
  
  Git Branch Validation (SECOND):
  - Check current git branch
  - STOP IMMEDIATELY if on develop or main branches (user must create feature branch: feature/{taskId}-brief-description)
  - STOP IMMEDIATELY if branch doesn't follow feature/{taskId}-* format
  - Check for uncommitted changes
  - STOP IMMEDIATELY if there are uncommitted changes (user must commit or stash first)
  
  Environment Setup:
  - Check if node_modules are installed
  - Validate .nvmrc configuration
  - Verify .npmrc if needed
  - Validate environment variables (.env files from Shadows if templates exist)
  - Check if development server is already running
  - Start the local development server if not running"
- Expected output: Claude initialization status (CLAUDE.md exists), git branch validation status, environment status report, confirmation of dependencies installed, Node version validation, environment variables status, dev server running status (existing or newly started)
- Context: Project root directory, git repository, and package.json configuration
- Action: This step must complete successfully before proceeding. STOPS and waits for user action if:
  - CLAUDE.md missing (user must run /init and type 'continue')
  - On develop/main branches (user must create feature branch)
  - Branch doesn't follow feature/{taskId}-* format
  - Uncommitted changes exist (user must commit or stash)
  - .env file is missing when template exists (user must get from Shadows)
  - Any other critical environment issues
  After user resolves issue, workflow continues automatically

### 2. Requirements Review & Clarification
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="frontend-orchestration::requirements-reviewer"
- Prompt: "Review the following feature requirements for completeness and clarity: $ARGUMENTS. Identify any missing information, ambiguous specifications, or unclear requirements. If critical information is missing, stop and request clarification from the user."
- Expected output: Requirements validation report, list of clarifying questions (if any), approved requirements document
- Context: User's feature request and project context
- Action: If clarification is needed, halt the workflow and wait for user input. Only proceed when all requirements are clear and complete.

## Phase 2: Development

### 3. Technology Detection & Agent Selection

**CRITICAL: Detect project technology BEFORE implementing the feature**

1. **Check for frontend framework and platform**:

   **Web Frameworks (check package.json):**
   - Look for @angular/core → Angular web project
   - Look for react (without react-native) → React web project
   - Look for next → Next.js project

   **Mobile Frameworks (check package.json and project files):**
   - Look for react-native → React Native mobile project
   - Look for expo → Expo mobile project
   - Look for @ionic → Ionic mobile project
   - Look for pubspec.yaml file → Flutter mobile project
   - Look for ios/ and android/ native directories → Native mobile project

   **Ambiguity scenarios:**
   - If MULTIPLE web frameworks found (Angular + React): STOP and ask user
   - If MULTIPLE mobile frameworks found: STOP and ask user
   - If NO clear framework indicators: STOP and ask user
   - If package.json missing or incomplete: STOP and ask user

2. **If unclear or ambiguous**:
   - Multiple frameworks detected
   - No clear framework indicators
   - Package.json missing or incomplete
   - Both web and mobile frameworks present

   **→ STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask user:**
   "I detected [describe what was found]. Which technology should I use for this feature?
   - Angular (web)
   - React/Next.js (web)
   - React Native (mobile)
   - Flutter (mobile)

## Coordination Notes

### Phase Flow
- Phase 1 must complete successfully before Phase 2 begins
- Phase 2 must complete successfully before Phase 3 begins
- Phase 3 must complete successfully and receive **USER APPROVAL** before Phase 4 begins
- **APPROVAL CHECKPOINT**: After Phase 3, workflow STOPS and requests user approval
- Any environment issues must be resolved before development starts
- Requirements clarification is mandatory if any ambiguity exists
- Development phase proceeds only with validated, clear requirements
- Security audit is mandatory before feature is considered production-ready
- **User can request changes**: If not approved, workflow returns to Phase 2 with feedback
- Pull Request creation requires Redmine taskId from user
- Pull Request creation only proceeds with explicit user approval

### Phase 1 (Setup & Requirements)
- Project-setup agent checks Claude initialization FIRST (CLAUDE.md must exist)
- If CLAUDE.md missing: Stops and instructs user to run /init, waits for user confirmation
- After user runs /init and confirms, re-checks and continues
- Checks git branch SECOND (must be feature/{taskId}-*)
- STOPS if on develop or main branches (directs user to create feature branch)
- STOPS if branch doesn't follow naming convention
- STOPS if there are uncommitted changes (directs user to commit or stash)
- Verifies environment, dependencies, .env files, and dev server
- STOPS if .env template exists but actual .env is missing (directs to Shadows)
- Checks for already running dev server before starting a new one
- Requirements-reviewer agent validates requirement completeness and clarity
- STOPS if critical information is missing and requests user clarification

### Phase 2 (Development)
- **Technology detection is mandatory FIRST**: Check package.json and project structure for frameworks
  - **Web frameworks**: @angular/core (Angular), react + next (React/Next.js)
  - **Mobile frameworks**: react-native, expo, @ionic, pubspec.yaml (Flutter), native directories
- **Ambiguity handling**:
  - If multiple web frameworks found, STOP and ask user which to use
  - If multiple mobile frameworks found, STOP and ask user which to use
  - If no clear framework indicators, STOP and ask user which technology to use
  - If both web and mobile frameworks present, STOP and ask user which to use for this feature
- **Agent routing based on detection**:
  - **Angular web projects**: Use angular-developer agent
    - Detects Angular version and architecture (standalone vs NgModule)
    - Applies version-appropriate patterns (signals for 16+, control flow for 17+)
    - Uses OnPush change detection, proper subscription management
  - **React/Next.js web projects**: Use frontend-developer agent
    - Detects Next.js version and router type (App Router vs Pages Router)
    - Applies framework-specific patterns based on detection
  - **Mobile projects**: Use mobile-developer agent
    - Detects mobile framework (React Native, Flutter, Expo, Ionic, Native)
    - Applies platform-specific patterns and design guidelines
    - Handles native integrations, permissions, and offline capabilities
- Always detect and respect existing tooling (state management, styling, authentication, navigation)
- Continue with detected approaches for consistency, even if different from preferred stack
- Inform user about alternative tool benefits only when they provide clear, specific advantages
- Provide precise, measurable information about alternative approaches
- Maintain consistency with existing project patterns and architecture

### Phase 3 (Security Audit & Approval Checkpoint)
- Security-auditor agent performs comprehensive frontend security assessment

- **STOPS at approval checkpoint after audit completes**
- Presents summary to user with security findings
- Requests explicit approval to proceed to Phase 4
- If user requests changes: Returns to Phase 2 with feedback
- If user approves: Proceeds to Phase 4

### Phase 4 (Pull Request Creation)
- Uses git-actions::create-pull-request command to orchestrate PR workflow
- Command coordinates pull-request-manager agent through 4 steps:
  1. Prerequisites validation (commits, push, branch name, GitHub CLI)
  2. Information gathering (taskId, summary, security results, changes)
  3. Content generation (commit message, PR title, description)
  4. PR creation (automated or manual with instructions)
- Requests Redmine taskId from user if not already provided
- Verifies all changes are committed and branch is pushed
- Generates standardized PR title: [#taskId] Description
- Generates comprehensive PR description with:
  - Feature summary and changes
  - Security audit results from Phase 3
