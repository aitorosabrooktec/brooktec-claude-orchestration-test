Orchestrate frontend feature development:

[Extended thinking: This workflow coordinates specialized agents to deliver a secure, production-ready frontend feature with proper setup validation, clear requirements, security compliance, and user approval before PR creation. The workflow ensures the development environment is properly configured (including environment variables from Shadows), validates requirement clarity, proceeds with framework-aware implementation using best practices for modern React development, performs comprehensive security auditing, and then STOPS to request explicit user approval. The user reviews the implementation and security findings before deciding to either proceed to PR creation or request additional changes. This approval checkpoint ensures quality control and gives the user final say before submitting the feature for review. The frontend developer agent automatically detects existing tooling (Next.js version, state management, styling, authentication) and adapts accordingly, while informing users about alternative approaches when beneficial.]

## Phase 1: Setup & Requirements Validation

### 1. Project Setup Verification
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="frontend-orchestration::project-setup"
- Prompt: "Verify and setup the development environment for the project. 
  
  Claude Project Initialization (FIRST):
  - Check if CLAUDE.md file exists in project root
  - If CLAUDE.md doesn't exist: 
    - STOP and inform user to run /init in the chat
    - Wait for user to execute /init and confirm completion
    - Re-check for CLAUDE.md after user confirms
    - Continue with remaining setup once verified
  
  Git Branch Validation (SECOND):
  - Check current git branch
  - STOP IMMEDIATELY if on develop or main branches (user must create feature branch: feature/{taskId}-brief-description)
  - STOP IMMEDIATELY if branch doesn't follow feature/{taskId}-* format
  - Check for uncommitted changes
  - STOP IMMEDIATELY if there are uncommitted changes (user must commit or stash first)
  
  Environment Setup:
  - Check if node_modules are installed
  - Validate .nvmrc configuration
  - Verify .npmrc if needed
  - Validate environment variables (.env files from Shadows if templates exist)
  - Check if development server is already running
  - Start the local development server if not running"
- Expected output: Claude initialization status (CLAUDE.md exists), git branch validation status, environment status report, confirmation of dependencies installed, Node version validation, environment variables status, dev server running status (existing or newly started)
- Context: Project root directory, git repository, and package.json configuration
- Action: This step must complete successfully before proceeding. STOPS and waits for user action if:
  - CLAUDE.md missing (user must run /init and type 'continue')
  - On develop/main branches (user must create feature branch)
  - Branch doesn't follow feature/{taskId}-* format
  - Uncommitted changes exist (user must commit or stash)
  - .env file is missing when template exists (user must get from Shadows)
  - Any other critical environment issues
  After user resolves issue, workflow continues automatically

### 2. Requirements Review & Clarification
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="frontend-orchestration::requirements-reviewer"
- Prompt: "Review the following feature requirements for completeness and clarity: $ARGUMENTS. Identify any missing information, ambiguous specifications, or unclear requirements. If critical information is missing, stop and request clarification from the user."
- Expected output: Requirements validation report, list of clarifying questions (if any), approved requirements document
- Context: User's feature request and project context
- Action: If clarification is needed, halt the workflow and wait for user input. Only proceed when all requirements are clear and complete.

## Phase 2: Development

### 3. Frontend Feature Implementation
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="frontend-mobile-development::frontend-developer"
- Prompt: "Implement the following frontend feature: $ARGUMENTS. 
  
  Detection phase:
  - Check package.json to detect if Next.js is being used and its version
  - Check for app/ or pages/ directory structure
  - Detect state management: check for any existing library (continue if found), otherwise use Zustand
  - Detect styling: check for any existing approach (continue if found), otherwise use SCSS
  - Detect authentication: check for existing auth implementation (continue if found)
  - For each detected tool that differs from preferred stack: inform user about preferred tool benefits ONLY if they provide clear advantages, then continue with existing approach
  
  Implementation phase:
  - Build React components with proper TypeScript types using patterns appropriate for the detected framework and version
  - Implement state management with detected approach (use existing library if found, otherwise Zustand)
  - Style components using detected approach (use existing approach if found, otherwise SCSS)
  - Implement authentication using detected approach (use existing if found, otherwise custom API-based with JWT)
  - Handle API integration with proper error handling and loading states
  - Ensure responsive design and follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
  - Include proper error boundaries and optimize for performance
  
  Communication:
  - If using tools different from preferred stack, inform user once about alternative benefits (only if advantageous)
  - Provide specific, measurable advantages (e.g., performance metrics, feature capabilities)
  - Always continue with detected approach for consistency"
- Expected output: React components (with Next.js-specific patterns if detected), TypeScript types, state management implementation (using detected library or Zustand default), styles using detected approach (or SCSS default), API integration code with detected auth approach (or custom API-based default), responsive styles, accessibility implementations, unit tests for components, optional note about alternative tools if they provide advantages
- Context: Validated requirements from Phase 1, existing project structure and design system, framework version and routing approach, state management library, styling approach
- Action: Implement the complete feature with production-ready code, following project conventions and framework-specific best practices.

## Phase 3: Security Audit & Compliance

### 4. Security Audit & Vulnerability Assessment
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="security-compliance::security-auditor"
- Prompt: "Perform comprehensive security audit of the implemented frontend feature: $ARGUMENTS.
  
  Frontend Security Assessment:
  - Review authentication implementation for security vulnerabilities (token storage, session management, CSRF protection)
  - Check for XSS vulnerabilities in component rendering and user input handling
  - Validate input sanitization and output encoding
  - Review API integration for secure communication (HTTPS, headers, CORS configuration)
  - Check for sensitive data exposure in client-side code or console logs
  - Verify proper error handling without information leakage
  - Assess security headers implementation (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS)
  - Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities
  
  OWASP Top 10 Frontend Checks:
  - Broken Access Control: Verify proper authorization checks before sensitive operations
  - Cryptographic Failures: Check for secure data transmission and storage
  - Injection: Validate protection against XSS, SQL injection in API calls
  - Insecure Design: Review security architecture and patterns
  - Security Misconfiguration: Check for exposed credentials, debug mode, default configs
  - Vulnerable Components: Scan dependencies for security vulnerabilities
  - Authentication Failures: Review authentication implementation and session management
  - Data Integrity Failures: Check for secure data validation and integrity checks
  - Logging Failures: Verify security events are logged without sensitive data exposure
  - Server-Side Request Forgery: Check for SSRF vulnerabilities in API calls
  
  Compliance & Best Practices:
  - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Data privacy considerations (localStorage vs httpOnly cookies)
  - TypeScript type safety (no 'any' types that could hide security issues)
  - Environment variable security (no secrets in client-side code)
  - Rate limiting considerations for API calls
  
  Output Requirements:
  - Security findings report with severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Specific remediation recommendations for each finding
  - Code examples for security fixes where applicable
  - Compliance checklist status
  - Security score and risk assessment"
- Expected output: Comprehensive security audit report, vulnerability assessment with severity ratings, specific remediation steps, compliance status, security best practices recommendations
- Context: Implemented feature from Phase 2, authentication patterns used, API integration approach, detected framework and libraries
- Action: Identify security vulnerabilities and provide actionable remediation steps. If critical vulnerabilities are found, flag them for immediate attention before feature deployment.

## Coordination Notes

### Phase Flow
- Phase 1 must complete successfully before Phase 2 begins
- Phase 2 must complete successfully before Phase 3 begins
- Phase 3 must complete successfully and receive **USER APPROVAL** before Phase 4 begins
- **APPROVAL CHECKPOINT**: After Phase 3, workflow STOPS and requests user approval
- Any environment issues must be resolved before development starts
- Requirements clarification is mandatory if any ambiguity exists
- Development phase proceeds only with validated, clear requirements
- Security audit is mandatory before feature is considered production-ready
- **User can request changes**: If not approved, workflow returns to Phase 2 with feedback
- Pull Request creation requires Redmine taskId from user
- Pull Request creation only proceeds with explicit user approval

### Phase 1 (Setup & Requirements)
- Project-setup agent checks Claude initialization FIRST (CLAUDE.md must exist)
- If CLAUDE.md missing: Stops and instructs user to run /init, waits for user confirmation
- After user runs /init and confirms, re-checks and continues
- Checks git branch SECOND (must be feature/{taskId}-*)
- STOPS if on develop or main branches (directs user to create feature branch)
- STOPS if branch doesn't follow naming convention
- STOPS if there are uncommitted changes (directs user to commit or stash)
- Verifies environment, dependencies, .env files, and dev server
- STOPS if .env template exists but actual .env is missing (directs to Shadows)
- Checks for already running dev server before starting a new one
- Requirements-reviewer agent validates requirement completeness and clarity
- STOPS if critical information is missing and requests user clarification

### Phase 2 (Development)
- Frontend developer agent automatically detects framework and version from package.json
- Next.js patterns are applied only when Next.js is detected in the project
- Implementation adapts to App Router (app/) or Pages Router (pages/) structure
- Always detect and respect existing tooling (state management, styling, authentication)
- Continue with detected approaches for consistency, even if different from preferred stack
- Inform user about alternative tool benefits only when they provide clear, specific advantages
- Provide precise, measurable information about alternative approaches
- Maintain consistency with existing project patterns and architecture

### Phase 3 (Security Audit & Approval Checkpoint)
- Security-auditor agent performs comprehensive frontend security assessment
- Covers OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities specific to frontend
- Reviews authentication implementation, XSS protection, data exposure
- Validates security headers, dependency vulnerabilities, and compliance
- Flags critical vulnerabilities for immediate remediation
- Provides specific, actionable remediation steps with code examples
- Documents security score and risk assessment
- **STOPS at approval checkpoint after audit completes**
- Presents summary to user with security findings
- Requests explicit approval to proceed to Phase 4
- If user requests changes: Returns to Phase 2 with feedback
- If user approves: Proceeds to Phase 4

### Phase 4 (Pull Request Creation)
- Uses git-actions::create-pull-request command to orchestrate PR workflow
- Command coordinates pull-request-manager agent through 4 steps:
  1. Prerequisites validation (commits, push, branch name, GitHub CLI)
  2. Information gathering (taskId, summary, security results, changes)
  3. Content generation (commit message, PR title, description)
  4. PR creation (automated or manual with instructions)
- Requests Redmine taskId from user if not already provided
- Verifies all changes are committed and branch is pushed
- Generates standardized PR title: [#taskId] Description
- Generates comprehensive PR description with:
  - Feature summary and changes
  - Security audit results from Phase 3
  - Testing information
  - Complete checklist
- Links to Redmine task for full traceability
- Provides step-by-step manual instructions (current implementation)
- Future: Will use GitHub CLI/MCP for fully automated PR creation
